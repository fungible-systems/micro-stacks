> Tiny libraries for building the next generation of Stacks apps.

**NOTE: THIS LIBRARY HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED, IT IS IN ALPHA STATE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK / DISCRETION**  

`micro-stacks` aims to be the primary package modern Typescript (+javascript) projects used to build apps in the [Stacks ecosystem](https://stacks.co), with a list of very specific goals:

- Core has no extra dependencies ([just 1 dependency](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1)).
- Modular: take what you need, leave what you don't.
- ESM based, works with all modern bundlers.
- 100% deno compatible.
- Expo / React Native support.
- Un-opinionated core.
- Opinionated framework integrations.
- Use with wallet based authenticators.
- Highly typed -- written in typescript.
- Well tested.
