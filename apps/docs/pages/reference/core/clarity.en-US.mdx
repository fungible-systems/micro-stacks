# Clarity

Clarity is a new language that brings smart contracts to Bitcoin. It is a decidable language, meaning you can know, with
certainty, from the code itself what the program will do. Clarity is interpreted (not compiled) & the source code is
published on the blockchain. Clarity gives developers a safe way to build complex smart contracts. The Clarity open-source
project is supported by the [Stacks ecosystem](https://stacks.org), [Hiro PBC](https://hiro.so), & [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/).

These docs will go over:
- What are the values and types in Clarity?
- How do I interact with Clarity in javascript?
- Where can I learn more about writing Clarity smart contracts?
