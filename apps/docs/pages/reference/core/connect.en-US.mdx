# Connect

`micro-stacks/connect` is the module that deals with interactions between wallets and your application. This means if you need to implement authentication or transaction signing, this library is playing a role in that.

More often than not, you as an app developer will never need to use this package directly. If you are building a React application, you should check out the docs on [Authentication](../integrations/react/authentication.md) and [Transactions](transactions.md).


## Authentication

`micro-stacks/connect` exports an `authenticate` method that takes a few parameters:

#### AuthOptions

The authOptions object contains data specific to your application. This includes things like `appDetails` which is an object that contains the `name` and `icon` fields.&#x20;

Additionally, you are able to pass some callbacks that happen at different events during the authentication process: `onFinish` and `onCancel`.

#### StorageAdapter

The storageAdapter parameter is to instruct where and how to save the session for your users. The default value for this is `localStorage`.

#### Serialize

This is the serialize function that will run when saving the authentication session. Default is `JSON.stringify`.

## Transaction signing

`micro-stacks/connect` exports a number of functions to construct the tokens that will be sent to the wallet of your users for them to sign.&#x20;

### openTransactionPopup

```typescript
import { openTransactionPopup } from 'micro-stacks/connect';
import type { FinishedTxData } from 'micro-stacks/connect';


function onFinish(data: FinishedTxData){
  console.log('finished!');
  console.log(data);
}

function onCancel(errorMessage: string){
  console.log('something went wrong!');
  console.log(errorMessage);
}

async function handleTxSigning(token: string){
  // promise will resolve when finished or canceled
  await openTransactionPopup({ token, onFinish, onCancel })
}
```

### makeStxTransferToken

This method creates a STX token transfer token which would be sent to a wallet for a user to sign with their private keys.

### makeContractCallToken

This method is used to construct the token that is sent over to the wallet for a user to sign.

```typescript
import { bytesToHex, utf8ToBytes } from 'micro-stacks/common';
import { bufferCV, uintCV } from 'micro-stacks/clarity';
import { getRandomBytes, hashRipemd160 } from 'micro-stacks/crypto';
import { hashSha256 } from 'micro-stacks/crypto-sha';

// import our method
import { makeContractCallToken } from 'micro-stacks/connect';

async function createBnsPreorderToken(): Promise<string> {
    const privateKey = bytesToHex(getRandomBytes()); // this would be the appPrivateKey
    const salt = 'asdadasdasda';
    const fqn = 'jude.id';
    const sha256 = hashSha256(utf8ToBytes(`${fqn}${salt}`));
    const hash160 = hashRipemd160(sha256);

    // create the token
    const token = await makeContractCallToken({
      privateKey,
      functionName: 'name-preorder',
      contractAddress: 'SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78',
      contractName: 'bns',
      functionArgs: [bufferCV(hash160), uintCV(200000)],
    });

    return token
}
```
