# Core

The core package `micro-stacks` is a collection of many different sub-modules which all serve different purposes.

## Installation

<InstallTabs>micro-stacks</InstallTabs>

While there is a single package to install, each module within `micro-stacks` can be safely imported without polluting
your application with code from other modules. This allows for very high levels of tree-shakeability.

## Modules

### **Clarity**

The `micro-stacks/clarity` module includes all the code required to interact with Clarity in a JavaScript environment. This includes things like parsing and constructing Clarity Values.

```ts
import { uintCV } from 'micro-stacks/clarity';

const clarityValue = uintCV('10');
```

### **Common**

This module exports helpful utilities that many of the other modules make use of.

### **Connect**

`micro-stacks/connect` is the module that handles all communication between a given application and any Stacks based
wallet. This included functionality around authentication and signing transactions.&#x20;

### **Crypto**

As the name implies, this module handles all of the crypto related functionality.

### **Network**

`micro-stacks/network` handles anything to do with constructing network objects related to Stacks.&#x20;

### **Storage**

### **Transactions**

This module deals with constructing Stacks Transactions that then can be signed by a given wallet.&#x20;
