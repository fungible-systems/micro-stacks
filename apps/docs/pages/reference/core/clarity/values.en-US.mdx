# Clarity Values

Clarity is a strongly-typed language. Its types define both what kind of data can be stored and how
data should be formatted within Clarity variables. This language feature means developers need to
declare variables and type values correctly but it also ensures that Clarity contracts are very
predictable. `micro-stacks` has a full implementation of Clarity Values (CV) as well as a number of
helpers to make it easier for developers to focus on the core application functionality.

## Clarity Type System

Here is a brief overview of Clarity's types and their corresponding Clarity Values:

| Import type     | Clarity Type                                          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                               |
