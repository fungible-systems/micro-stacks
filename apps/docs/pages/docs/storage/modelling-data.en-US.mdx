# Modeling data for Gaia

<Integrations.Tabs />

Gaia is a pretty simple key-value store. There are endpoints for writing data, reading data, listing
files, and deleting files. In order to build more advanced applications, it's important to think
about how we can model out our data such that we don't lose files randomly, and can easily know the
state of our data.

Micro-stacks exposes some helpful abstractions to make this really easy.

## Model

Each framework specific library will expose a function you can use to create new Models:

```tsx
import { useModel } from '@micro-stacks/react';

interface ModelType {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  emailAddress: string;
}

const model = useModel<ModelType>('MyModelType');
```

### Listing Model IDs

When interacting with Gaia, it's often best to create a file that serves as an index for our Model,
which would allow us to fetch many entries, or list out specific entries of your Model. Because of
how the underlying Model class names files, we are also able to do some ordering without knowing the
contents of the file.

#### Ordering

#### Paginating

### Saving an entry

Below we can see an example for saving a model with the built in `save` function:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { useModel } from '@micro-stacks/react';

interface ModelType {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  emailAddress: string;
}

const SaveButton = (props: ModelType) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = React.useState(false);
  const model = useModel<ModelType>('MyModelType');

  const onClick = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    await model.save({
      firstName: props.firstName,
      lastName: props.lastName,
      emailAddress: props.emailAddress,
    });
    setIsLoading(false);
  };

  const buttonLabel = isLoading ? 'saving...' : 'save model';

  return <button onClick={onClick}>{buttonLabel}</button>;
};
```

#### Saving many entries

### Deleting an entry
