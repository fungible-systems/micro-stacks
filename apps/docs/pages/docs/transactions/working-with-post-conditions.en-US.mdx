# Working with Post Conditions

Post conditions are a unique and important feature within Stacks. They are conditions that users or apps can place on
transactions that will cause the transaction to fail should the conditions not be met. To put it more simply: they are
protections against unknowingly loosing assets. Post-conditions are defined in terms of which assets each account sends
or does not send during the transaction's execution.

**Types of post conditions**
- [STX token post conditions](#stx-token-post-conditions)
- [Fungible token post conditions](#fungible-token-post-conditions)
- [Non-fungible token post conditions](#non-fungible-token-post-conditions)


## Technical overview

A key use-case of smart contracts is to allow programmatic control over the assets in one or more accounts. However,
where there is programmatic control, there are bound to be bugs. In the world of smart contract programming, bugs
(intentional or not) can have severe consequences to the user's well-being. In particular, bugs can destroy a user's
assets and cause them to lose wealth. Transaction post-conditions are a feature meant to limit the damage a bug can do
in terms of destroying a user's assets.

Post-conditions are intended to be used to force a transaction to abort if the transaction would cause a principal to
send an asset in a way that is not to the user's liking.

The Stacks blockchain supports an "allow" or "deny" mode for evaluating post-conditions:
  - in "allow" mode, other asset transfers not covered by the post-conditions are permitted,
  - but in "deny" mode, no other asset transfers are permitted besides those named in the post-conditions.

Post-conditions are meant to be added by the user (or by the user's wallet software) at the moment they sign with their
origin account. Because the user defines the post-conditions, the user has the power to protect themselves from buggy or
malicious smart contracts proactively, so even undiscovered bugs cannot steal or destroy their assets if they are guarded
with post-conditions. Well-designed wallets would provide an intuitive user interface for encoding post-conditions, as well
as provide a set of recommended mitigations based on whether or not the transaction would interact with a known-buggy
smart contract.

    **tl;dr:** post conditions should describe the expected results of a given transaction.

### Post-Condition Limitations

Post-conditions do not consider who currently owns an asset when the transaction finishes, nor do they consider the sequence
of owners an asset had during its execution. It only encodes who sent an asset, and how much. This information is much cheaper
to track, and requires no I/O to process (processing time is O(n) in the number of post-conditions). Users who want richer
post-conditions are encouraged to deploy their own proxy contracts for making such queries.

<Callout type='info'>
    **tl;dr:** this means that you must consider only the result of a given transaction and which addresses will end up with a given asset.

## STX token post conditions

STX token post conditions are pretty straight forward. There are functions you can use from `micro-stacks/transactions`
called `makeStandardSTXPostCondition` and `makeContractSTXPostCondition` that take a few parameters:

- `principal`: the principal (Stacks address) of the participant this condition affects
- `contractName`: (_only `makeStandardSTXPostCondition`_) the contract name of the participating contract
- `conditionCode`: the `FungibleConditionCode` for this condition, available options:
  - `FungibleConditionCode.Equal`: an exact amount _will_ be transferred
  - `FungibleConditionCode.Greater`: an amount greater than X _can_ be transferred
  - `FungibleConditionCode.GreaterEqual`: an amount greater or equal to X _will_ be transferred
  - `FungibleConditionCode.Less`: an amount less than X _can_ be transferred
  - `FungibleConditionCode.LessEqual`: an amount less than or equal to X _will_ be transferred
- `amount`: the amount without decimals (in the case of STX, uSTX)

### Example

```ts
import {
  makeStandardSTXPostCondition,
  makeContractSTXPostCondition,
  FungibleConditionCode
} from 'micro-stacks/transactions';

// if the participant is a standard principal
const stxPostCondition = makeStandardSTXPostCondition(
  'ST1X6M947Z7E58CNE0H8YJVJTVKS9VW0PHEG3NHN3',
  FungibleConditionCode.Equal,
  10n
);

// if the participant is a contract principal
const stxPostConditionForContract = makeContractSTXPostCondition(
  'ST1X6M947Z7E58CNE0H8YJVJTVKS9VW0PHEG3NHN3',
  'my-contract'
  FungibleConditionCode.Equal,
  10n
);
```

## Fungible token post conditions

Post conditions for fungible tokens other than STX tokens are nearly the same, however, you need to pass details of the asset
the condition is about. There are functions you can use from `micro-stacks/transactions` called `makeStandardFungiblePostCondition`
and `makeContractFungiblePostCondition` that take a few parameters:

- `principal`: the principal (Stacks address) of the participant this condition affects
- `contractName`: (_only `makeContractFungiblePostCondition`_) the contract name of the participating contract
- `conditionCode`: the `FungibleConditionCode` for this condition, available options:
  - `FungibleConditionCode.Equal`: an exact amount _will_ be transferred
  - `FungibleConditionCode.Greater`: an amount greater than X _can_ be transferred
  - `FungibleConditionCode.GreaterEqual`: an amount greater or equal to X _will_ be transferred
  - `FungibleConditionCode.Less`: an amount less than X _can_ be transferred
  - `FungibleConditionCode.LessEqual`: an amount less than or equal to X _will_ be transferred
- `amount`: the amount without decimals (in the case of STX, uSTX)

Additionally, you need to manually define the asset for the post condition using `createAssetInfo`, the parameters this function takes are:
- `contractAddress`: the contract address (principal) of the specific asset you're working with
- `contractName`: the name of the contract for this asset
- `assetName`: the name of the asset as defined in the contract

### Example

```ts
import {
  makeStandardFungiblePostCondition,
  makeContractFungiblePostCondition,
  createAssetInfo,
  FungibleConditionCode,
} from 'micro-stacks/transactions';

// USDA
const asset = createAssetInfo(
  'SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR',
  'usda-token',
  'usda-token'
)

// if the participant is a standard principal
const stxPostCondition = makeStandardFungiblePostCondition(
  'ST1X6M947Z7E58CNE0H8YJVJTVKS9VW0PHEG3NHN3',
  FungibleConditionCode.Equal,
  10n,
  asset
);

// if the participant is a contract principal
const stxPostConditionForContract = makeContractFungiblePostCondition(
  'ST1X6M947Z7E58CNE0H8YJVJTVKS9VW0PHEG3NHN3',
  'my-contract'
  FungibleConditionCode.Equal,
  10n,
  asset
);
```

## Non-fungible token post conditions

Post conditions for NFTs are slightly different than STX or fungible token post conditions, in that the `conditionCode`
for NFTs can only be one of two values: `Owns` or `DoesNotOwn`. The functions we will use are `makeStandardNonFungiblePostCondition`
or `makeContractNonFungiblePostCondition`, and these are the parameters:

- `principal`: the principal (Stacks address) of the participant this condition affects
- `contractName`: (_only `makeContractNonFungiblePostCondition`_) the contract name of the participating contract
- `conditionCode`: the `NonFungibleConditionCode` for this condition, available options:
  - `NonFungibleConditionCode.Owns`: this condition requires that at the end of the transaction, the principal participating will _own_ this asset
  - `NonFungibleConditionCode.DoesNotOwn`: this condition requires that at the end of the transaction, the principal participating will _NOT own_ this asset
- `assetInfo`: the information about the asset (see below)
- `assetId`: the ClarityValue of the asset ID (see below)

Additionally, you need to manually define the asset for the post condition using `createAssetInfo`, the parameters this function takes are:
- `contractAddress`: the contract address (principal) of the specific asset you're working with
- `contractName`: the name of the contract for this asset
- `assetName`: the name of the asset as defined in the contract

With NFTs, you also need to provide the asset id (eg token id) as a `ClarityValue`, see the example below for more details.

### Example

```ts
import {
  makeStandardNonFungiblePostCondition,
  makeContractNonFungiblePostCondition,
  NonFungibleConditionCode,
  createAssetInfo
} from 'micro-stacks/transactions';
import { uintCV } from 'micro-stacks/clarity';

// Megapont robot expansion contract asset
const asset = createAssetInfo(
  'SP3D6PV2ACBPEKYJTCMH7HEN02KP87QSP8KTEH335',
  'megapont-robot-component-expansion-nft',
  'Megapont-Robot-Component'
);

const nftPostCondition = makeStandardNonFungiblePostCondition(
  'SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR',
  NonFungibleConditionCode.Owns,
  asset,
  uintCV('60149') // the token ID
);

const nftPostConditionForContract = makeStandardNonFungiblePostCondition(
  'SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR',
  'my-contract',
  NonFungibleConditionCode.Owns,
  asset,
  uintCV('60149')
);
```
