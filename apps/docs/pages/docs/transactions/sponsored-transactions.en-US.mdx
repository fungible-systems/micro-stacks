# Sponsored Transactions

<Integrations.Tabs />

One of the unique features of the Stacks blockchain is that it has native support for "sponsored
transactions". A sponsored transaction is signed by a user, but the fee is paid for by a third
party. This allows for improved user experiences where a user doesn't need to own Stacks in order to
make transactions.

## Implementing sponsored transactions

In most cases, the flow for a sponsored transactions is:

- When [signing a transaction](/docs/transactions), include `sponsored: true` as one of the
  transaction options
- After the transaction is signed, the callback includes a `txRaw` property, which is a hex-encoded
  transaction. This transaction is **not** broadcasted to the blockchain yet.
- Pass the `txRaw` encoded transaction to an API route
- In the API route, sign the transaction using a different private key. The account controlled by
  this private key is paying the fee.

### Signing transactions

<Callout type="info">
  For more information about signing transactions, check out the docs for [contract
  calls](/docs/transactions/contract-calls).
</Callout>

In order to implement sponsored transactions, you **must** include the `sponsored: true` parameter.
Each of the transaction signing functions support this parameter. When this option is included, the
transaction payload is signed slightly differently. Additionally, the transaction is not immediately
broadcasted.

<Integrations.React>

```tsx {10}
import { useOpenContractCall } from '@micro-stacks/react';
import { useCallback } from 'react';

export const ContractCall = () => {
  const { openContractCall } = useOpenContractCall();

  const signTx = useCallback(() => {
    openContractCall({
      ...params, // all the usual parameters
      sponsored: true,
    });
  }, []);

  return <button onClick={signTx}>Sign Transaction</button>;
};
```

</Integrations.React>

<Integrations.Vanilla>

```tsx {12}
import { client } from './micro-stacks-client';
import { TxType } from '@micro-stacks/client';
import type { FinishedTxData } from 'micro-stacks/connect';

const signTx = async () => {
  let payload: FinishedTxData | undefined;
  await client.signTransaction(TxType.ContractCall, {
    ...params, // all the usual parameters
    onFinish(finishedTxData: FinishedTxData) {
      payload = finishedTxData;
    },
    sponsored: true,
  });
  return payload;
};
```

</Integrations.Vanilla>

### Server-side sponsoring transactions

When implementing sponsored transactions, we need a backend API that supports signing a transaction
as the sponsor. To do this, use the `sponsorTransaction` function from `micro-stacks/transactions`.
We'll need to provide the transaction and our private key as parameters.

You'll need a private key in order to sign the transaction as a sponsor. In this example, the
private key is configured as an environment variable.

```ts
import {
  deserializeTransaction,
  sponsorTransaction,
  broadcastTransaction,
} from 'micro-stacks/transactions';

export const sponsorHex = async (txHex: string) => {
  const tranaction = deserializeTransaction(txHex);
  const sponsorPrivateKey = process.env.SPONSOR_PRIVATE_KEY;
  if (!sponsorPrivateKey) throw new Error('SPONSOR_PRIVATE_KEY is required');

  const network = new StacksTestnet();
  const sponsoredTx = await sponsorTransaction({
    transaction,
    sponsorPrivateKey: sponsorPrivateKey,
    network,
    fee: '1000',
  });
  const result = await broadcastTransaction(sponsoredTx, network);
  if ('error' in result) {
    throw new Error(`Broadcast failed: ${result.error}`);
  }
  return result.txid;
};
```

The `sponsorTransaction` parameters are:

- `transaction`: A `StacksTransaction` instance. This **must** already be signed by the original
  sender
- `sponsorPrivateKey`: a hex private key, which corresponds to the account paying the transaction
  fee
- `network`: the `StacksNetwork` we want to interface with
- `fee`: optionally, a fee can be provided. If `fee` is omitted, then a fee estimation is used.
- `sponsorNonce`: optionally, we can specify the nonce used. This is helpful in cases where our
  backend needs to handle many consecutive sponsored transactions.

### Putting it all together

Now that we have a backend API setup to handle sponsoring, we can use it after signing the
transaction.

<Integrations.React>

```tsx
import { useOpenContractCall } from '@micro-stacks/react';
import { useCallback } from 'react';

export const ContractCall = () => {
  const { openContractCall } = useOpenContractCall();

  const signTx = useCallback(() => {
    const receipt = openContractCall({
      ...params, // all the usual parameters
      sponsored: true,
    });

    if (typeof receipt === 'undefined') return; // if the popup was closed

    // Send it to our API
    const result = await fetch('/api/sponsor', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ txHex }),
    });

    // get the txid from the response
    const { txid } = await result.json();

    console.log('Transaction submitted!', txid);
  }, [openContractCall]);

  return <button onClick={signTx}>Sign Transaction</button>;
};
```

</Integrations.React>
<Integrations.Vanilla>

```tsx
import { client } from './micro-stacks-client';
import { TxType } from '@micro-stacks/client';
import type { FinishedTxData } from 'micro-stacks/connect';

const signTx = async () => {
  let payload: FinishedTxData | undefined;
  await client.signTransaction(TxType.ContractCall, {
    ...params, // all the usual parameters
    onFinish(finishedTxData: FinishedTxData) {
      payload = finishedTxData;
    },
    sponsored: true,
  });
  return payload;
};

const signTxAndSponsor = async () => {
  const payload = await signTx();

  if (typeof payload === 'undefined') return; // if the popup was closed

  // Send it to our API
  const result = await fetch('/api/sponsor', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ txHex: payload?.txRaw }),
  });

  // get the txid from the response
  const { txid } = await result.json();

  console.log('Transaction submitted!', txid);
};
```

</Integrations.Vanilla>

## Advanced Usage

### Authorizing sponsored transactions

Most of the time, you'll want to only sponsor specific transactions. For example, you might want to
only sponsor your app's contracts, or only sponsor transactions for specific users. You can
implement that kind of authorization before signing.

```ts
export function verifyContractCall(tx: StacksTransaction) {
  // only contract call types
  if (tx.payload.payloadType !== 2) return false;

  const myContract = createAddress('SP123.my-contract');
  // validate contract address
  if (tx.payload.contractAddress !== myContract) return false;

  // maybe authorize the signer
  if (!verifySigner(tx.auth.spendingCondition.signer)) return false;

  return true;
}

export async function sponsorTx(tx: StacksTransaction) {
  if (!verifyContractCall(tx)) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  }
  // continue sponsoring
}
```

### Managing sponsor nonce

In production, you might want to keep track of your sponsor account's nonce in a custom way. By
default, `sponsorTransaction` fetches the sponsor's nonce from the network. If you have many
requests to sponsor transactions coming in simultaneously, you should keep track of your nonce using
some central data store.

```ts
export async function sponsorTx(tx: StacksTransaction) {
  // some method to fetch and update your next nonce
  const nonce = atomicFetchNextNonce();
  await sponsorTransaction({
    sponsorNonce: nonce,
    // other params
  });
}
```
