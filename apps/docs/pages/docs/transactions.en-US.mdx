# Transaction signing

<Integrations.Tabs />

<Integrations.React>
  When building Stacks apps, very often you'll want to request the user to sign and broadcast a
  transaction to the network. To do this, you need to interact with a connected Stacks wallet which
  can receive and use these requests. `@micro-stacks/react` exposes a number of hooks that make this
  really easy.

  When building Stacks apps, very often you'll want to request the user to sign and broadcast a
  transaction to the network. To do this, you need to interact with a connected Stacks wallet which
  can receive and use these requests. `@micro-stacks/client` exposes a number of functions that make
  this really easy.

There are three main types of transactions you can work with:

- [STX token transfer transactions](./transactions/stx-token-transfers)
- [Contract call transactions](./transactions/contract-calls)
- [Contract deploy transactions](./transactions/contract-deploys)

## Shared parameters

Before we dig into each specific type of transaction, there are some parameters that all transactions can make use of. This
is the shape of the shared parameters:

```ts
interface TransactionOptionsBase {
  onFinish?: (data: TxResponsePayload) => void;
  onCancel?: (error: string) => void;
  postConditionMode?: PostConditionMode;
  postConditions?: (string | PostCondition)[];
  sponsored?: boolean;
  attachment?: string;
}
```

### `onFinish` and `onCancel`

All callbacks that interact with a connected wallet can make use of `onFinish` and `onCancel`. When someone initiates a request
from an app and it finishes successfully, the wallet will return a payload to the requesting app with the following shape:

```json
{
  "txId": "0x...",
  "txRaw": "0x..."
}
```

The `txId` will allow you to send users to an explorer, or to fetch data from an API for the newly submitted transaction.

The `txRaw` is a deserialized instance of the `StacksTransaction` class that was submitted to the network.

### Post conditions

Post conditions are conditions put onto a transaction that are intended to prevent unknowingly losing assets. A post condition
will prevent any asset that isn't defined in a post condition from being sent.

`postConditionMode` can be set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`. The default is always `DENY`, meaning you will need to set post conditions
for any assets that will transfer as a result of the transaction. It is strongly recommended to never pass `ALLOW`, as any number of
transfers would be allowed to happen.

  conditions](./transactions/working-with-post-conditions).

### Sponsored transactions

Sponsored transactions are transactions that will be submitted to the network at a later date, and the fees will be covered by
another account.

To have the transaction signed with no fee, and not broadcast to the network, set `sponsored` to `true`.

### Attachments

Attachments are arbitrary hex-encoded data that can be included with a transaction. Currently, the only attachments that are
supported by the network are `zonefile` attachments associated with BNS activity.
