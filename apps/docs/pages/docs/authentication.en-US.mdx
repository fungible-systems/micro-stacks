# Authentication

<Integrations.Tabs />

The foundation of any Stacks based application is authentication. With `micro-stacks`, you are able to add authentication to
any JavaScript/TypeScript application. Stacks authentication is dependent on your users having a compatible wallet to authenticate with.

<Callout type={'info'}>
	The two primary wallets in the Stacks ecosystem are: the [Hiro Web Wallet](https://hiro.so/wallet/install-web) and the native (iOS and Android) wallet [Xverse](https://www.xverse.app/).
</Callout>

		If you are building an app using React, it is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that you make use of the React
		integrations. <Integrations.Action type="react">[View the React docs for authentication.]()</Integrations.Action>

		_P.S.: Vue and Svelte integrations are coming soon!_

</Integrations.Vanilla>

## Adding auth to your app

<Integrations.React>

<Callout type='info'>
  **Important**: before adding authentication, make sure you've [properly set up](./getting-started#setting-up-the-client) your application to work with `@micro-stacks/react`.
</Callout>

The primary way you'll implement authentication is via the `useAuth` hook. This hook exposes a few callbacks for
different functions: `openAuthRequest`, `signOut`, along with some helper variables: `isRequestPending` `isSignedIn`.

Check out the sample below for a very simple `WalletConnectButton` component:

```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@micro-stacks/react';

export const WalletConnectButton = () => {
  const { openAuthRequest, isRequestPending, signOut, isSignedIn } = useAuth();
  const label = isRequestPending ? 'Loading...' : isSignedIn ? 'Sign out' : 'Connect Stacks wallet';
  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        if (isSignedIn) await signOut();
        else await openAuthRequest();
      }}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};
```
<Callout type={'info'}>
	**Migrating from pre v1.0.0**

	The primary differences between the latest version and versions before v1.0.0 are as follows:

	- `handleSignIn` renamed to `openAuthRequest`
	- `handleSignOut` renamed to `signOut`
	- `isLoading` renamed to `isRequestPending`
	- **`session` is removed from this hook, use `useAccount` instead**
</Callout>
</Integrations.React>

<Integrations.Vanilla>
<Callout type='info'>
	**Important**: before adding using authentication, make sure you've [set up your client](./#overview) correctly.
</Callout>

The micro-stacks client will handle persistence for you, so all you need to do is have you users call `authenticate` from the client,
and once they have selected an account, the client will update automatically.

```typescript
import { client } from './my-client';

const authenticate = async () => {
  await client.authenticate({
    onFinish: (payload) => {
	  console.log(payload)
	}
  })
}
```
</Integrations.Vanilla>

## Server side session

If you are building an application that uses server side rendering, or want to share state with an api route, checkout these
handy resources for working with Stacks apps & server rendering:

## User account data

<Integrations.React>
To access the current signed in user data, you'll want to make use of the `useAccount` hook:

```ts
import { useAccount } from '@micro-stacks/react';
```

This hook will return an object with the shape:

```ts
interface Account {
  appPrivateKey?: string;
  stxAddress?: string;
  rawAddress?: [number, Uint8Array];
  identityAddress?: string;
  decentralizedID?: string;
  profileUrl?: string;
}
```
</Integrations.React>

<Integrations.Vanilla>
Once your users have authenticated, you will have access to their session state, such as their Stacks addresses and associated `appPrivateKey`.

```ts
import { client } from './my-client';

const stxAddress = client.stxAddress;
const appPrivateKey = client.account.appPrivateKey
```
</Integrations.Vanilla>
