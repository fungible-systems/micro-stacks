# Getting started

<Integrations.Tabs/>

<Integrations.React>
`@micro-stacks/react` is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with Stacks. This package makes it easy to connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages, interact with clarity smart contracts, and much more!
</Integrations.React>

<Integrations.Svelte>
`@micro-stacks/svelte` is the official Svelte library for building Stacks apps with `micro-stacks`. It contains everything you need to start working with Stacks. This package makes it easy to connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages, interact with clarity smart contracts, and much more!
</Integrations.Svelte>

<Integrations.Vue>
`@micro-stacks/vue` is the official Vue.js library for building Stacks apps with `micro-stacks`. It contains everything you need to start working with Stacks. This package makes it easy to connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages, interact with clarity smart contracts, and much more!
</Integrations.Vue>

<Integrations.Solid>
`@micro-stacks/solidjs` is the official Solid.js library for building Stacks apps with `micro-stacks`. It contains everything you need to start working with Stacks. This package makes it easy to connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages, interact with clarity smart contracts, and much more!
</Integrations.Solid>

<Integrations.Vanilla>
`@micro-stacks/client` is an all-in-one class containing everything you need to start working with Stacks. The client makes it easy to connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages, interact with clarity smart contracts, and much more!
</Integrations.Vanilla>

## Setting up the client

<Integrations.React>
To add `@micro-stacks/react` to your application, we only need to import the `ClientProvider` and pass it some details about your app: `appName` and `appIconUrl`. This component creates the React Context that all other functions within this package make use of.

```tsx {7-8}
import * as MicroStacks from '@micro-stacks/react';

// your app
function App() {
  return (
    <MicroStacks.ClientProvider
      appName="My sick app"
      appIconUrl="APP_ICON.png">
        <Router />
    </MicroStacks.ClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</Integrations.React>

<Integrations.Svelte>
To add `@micro-stacks/svelte` to your application, there are two main ways to do it:

Import the `ClientProvider` and pass it some details about your app: `appName` and `appIconUrl`. This component creates the Context that all other functions within this package make use of.

Or you can use the function `mountClient` and pass it the same details.

```tsx {7-8}
import * as MicroStacks from '@micro-stacks/svelte';

// your app
function App() {
  return (
    <MicroStacks.ClientProvider
      appName="My sick app"
      appIconUrl="APP_ICON.png">
        <Router />
    </MicroStacks.ClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</Integrations.Svelte>

<Integrations.Vanilla>

The `client` is the powerhouse of functionality which will drive all elements of your app that interact with a connected
Stacks wallet. To get started, you need to initiate your app with an instance of `MicroStacksClient`. Typically it's recommended
to create a new file `micro-stacks-client.ts` (or `.js`) that exports your client so you can use it throughout your application.


```tsx
// micro-stacks-client.ts

import { createClient } from '@micro-stacks/client';

const client = createClient({
    appName: 'My cool app',
    appIconUrl: 'https://mycool.app/my-cool-app-logo.png'
})

export { client }
```

```ts
// auth.ts

import { client } from './micro-stacks-client.ts';

const handleAuth = async () => {
  if(!client.hasSession) await client.authenticate()
}
```

In this example, we've created a new `client` and then created a function that will request the user to authenticate if
if there is no current session.
</Integrations.Vanilla>

<Callout>
	Please note: if the app needs to interact with a Stacks wallet, `appName` and `appIconUrl` are required.
</Callout>


### Parameters

The client can take a number of additional options:

#### `onAuthentication`

An optional callback that fires when authentication is completed successfully.

#### `onSignOut`
An optional callback that fires when a session is cleared. Useful if building a server-side rendered app.

#### `network`

Change the default network for the app. Available options: `mainnet`, `testnet`, `new StacksNetwork()`.

<Callout type={'info'}>
	You can read more about networks in Stacks apps on [the Networks page](/docs/getting-started/networks).
</Callout>

#### `storage`

You can pass a custom storage driver for the state of the client. Defaults to `localStorage`.

```ts
interface Storage {
  getItem: <Value = V>(key: string, defaultValue?: Value | null) => Value | null;
  setItem: <Value>(key: string, value: Value | null) => void;
  removeItem: (key: string) => void;
}
```

#### `onPersistState`
A callback to persist an instance of the client state as a dehydrated string value. Read more about persistence on [the Advanced Patterns page](/docs/getting-started/advanced-patterns).

#### `dehydratedState`
A string value of the dehydrated state of the client for hydration. Or a function that returns the value: `(key: string) => string | undefined` Read more about persistence on [the Advanced Patterns page](/docs/getting-started/advanced-patterns).

## Using the client

Now that you've set up your app, feel free to dig into some of the features you can start making use of:

- [Networks](/docs/getting-started/networks)
- [Transaction signing](/docs/transactions)
- [Message signing](/docs/message-signing)
- [Gaia & storage](/docs/storage)
