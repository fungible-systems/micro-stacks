# Getting started

<Integrations.Tabs />

<Integrations.React>
  `@micro-stacks/react` is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start
  working with Stacks. This package makes it easy to connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages,
  interact with clarity smart contracts, and much more!
</Integrations.React>

<Integrations.Svelte>
  `@micro-stacks/svelte` is the official Svelte library for building Stacks apps with
  `micro-stacks`. It contains everything you need to start working with Stacks. This package makes
  it easy to connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages, interact with clarity smart contracts, and
  much more!
</Integrations.Svelte>

<Integrations.Vue>
  `@micro-stacks/vue` is the official Vue.js library for building Stacks apps with `micro-stacks`.
  It contains everything you need to start working with Stacks. This package makes it easy to
  connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages, interact with clarity smart contracts, and much more!
</Integrations.Vue>

<Integrations.Solid>
  `@micro-stacks/solidjs` is the official Solid.js library for building Stacks apps with
  `micro-stacks`. It contains everything you need to start working with Stacks. This package makes
  it easy to connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages, interact with clarity smart contracts, and
  much more!
</Integrations.Solid>

<Integrations.Vanilla>
  `@micro-stacks/client` is an all-in-one class containing everything you need to start working with
  Stacks. The client makes it easy to connect to a Stacks wallet, sign messages, interact with
  clarity smart contracts, and much more!
</Integrations.Vanilla>

## Installation

<Callout type={'info'}>
  You can quickly create a new `micro-stacks` based app with this command: `npx create-ustx` or with your package manager of choice:

  <InstallTabs isCreate>ustx</InstallTabs>
</Callout>

<Integrations.React>
  <InstallTabs>@micro-stacks/react</InstallTabs>
</Integrations.React>

<Integrations.Svelte>
  <InstallTabs>@micro-stacks/svelte</InstallTabs>
</Integrations.Svelte>

<Integrations.Vue>
  <InstallTabs>@micro-stacks/vue</InstallTabs>
</Integrations.Vue>

<Integrations.Solid>
  <InstallTabs>@micro-stacks/solidjs</InstallTabs>
</Integrations.Solid>

<Integrations.Vanilla>
	<Callout emoji="âš›" type={'info'}>
		If you are building an app using a framework like React, Svelte, Vue, or Solid.js, it is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that you make use of the official integrations.
	</Callout>

    <InstallTabs>
    	@micro-stacks/client
    </InstallTabs>

</Integrations.Vanilla>

## Setting up the client

<Integrations.React>
To add `@micro-stacks/react` to your application, we only need to import the `ClientProvider` and pass it some details about your app: `appName` and `appIconUrl`. This component creates the React Context that all other functions within this package make use of.

```tsx {7-8}
import * as MicroStacks from '@micro-stacks/react';

// your app
function App() {
  return (
    <MicroStacks.ClientProvider
      appName="My sick app"
      appIconUrl="APP_ICON.png"
    >
      <Router />
    </MicroStacks.ClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</Integrations.React>

<Integrations.Svelte>
To add `@micro-stacks/svelte` to your application, there are two main ways to do it:

Import the `ClientProvider` and pass it some details about your app: `appName` and `appIconUrl`.
This component creates the Context that all other functions within this package make use of.

Or you can use the function `mountClient` and pass it the same details.

```svelte {3,7-8}
<script lang="ts">
  // App.svelte file
  import { ClientProvider } from "@micro-stacks/svelte";
</script>

<ClientProvider
  appName="Svelte + micro-stacks"
  appIconUrl="/icon.png"
>
  <main>
    // app stuff
  </main>
</ClientProvider>
```

Or if you want to use `mountClient`:

```svelte {3,5-8}
<script lang="ts">
  // App.svelte file
  import { mountClient } from "@micro-stacks/svelte";

  mountClient({
    appName: 'Svelte + micro-stacks',
    appIconUrl: '/icon.png'
  })
</script>

<main>
  // app stuff
</main>
```

</Integrations.Svelte>

<Integrations.Vue>
To add `@micro-stacks/vue` to your application, we need to set the context for the client. There is a function
`provideClient` which sets the context for the app and all the functions to make use of.

```vue {4, 6-9}
<script setup lang="ts">
  // This starter template is using Vue 3 <script setup> SFCs
  // Check out https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#script-setup
  import { provideClient } from '@micro-stacks/vue';

  provideClient({
    appName: 'Vue + micro-stacks',
    appIconUrl: window.location.href + 'assets/logo.png',
  });
</script>

<template>
  <img
    alt="Vue logo"
    src="./assets/logo.png"
  />
</template>
```

</Integrations.Vue>

<Integrations.Solid>
To add `@micro-stacks/solidjs` to your application, we need to set the context for the client. We can import `CLientContext` and
`useCreateClient` from `@micro-stacks/solidjs` to create the context that all other hooks make use of.

```tsx {1, 4, 6}
import { ClientContext, useCreateClient } from '@micro-stacks/solidjs';

const App = () => {
  const client = useCreateClient({ appName: 'solid + micro-stacks', appIconUrl: '/icon.png' });
  return (
    <ClientContext.Provider value={client}>{/* app components here */}</ClientContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

</Integrations.Solid>

<Integrations.Vanilla>

The `client` is the powerhouse of functionality which will drive all elements of your app that
interact with a connected Stacks wallet. To get started, you need to initiate your app with an
instance of `MicroStacksClient`. Typically it's recommended to create a new file
`micro-stacks-client.ts` (or `.js`) that exports your client so you can use it throughout your
application.

```tsx
// micro-stacks-client.ts

import { createClient } from '@micro-stacks/client';

const client = createClient({
  appName: 'My cool app',
  appIconUrl: 'https://mycool.app/my-cool-app-logo.png',
});

export { client };
```

```ts
// auth.ts

import { client } from './micro-stacks-client.ts';

const handleAuth = async () => {
  if (!client.hasSession) await client.authenticate();
};
```

In this example, we've created a new `client` and then created a function that will request the user
to authenticate if if there is no current session.

</Integrations.Vanilla>

<Callout>
  Please note: if the app needs to interact with a Stacks wallet, `appName` and `appIconUrl` are
  required.
</Callout>

### Parameters

The client can take a number of additional options:

#### `onAuthentication`

An optional callback that fires when authentication is completed successfully.

#### `onSignOut`

An optional callback that fires when a session is cleared. Useful if building a server-side rendered
app.

#### `network`

Change the default network for the app. Available options: `mainnet`, `testnet`,
`new StacksNetwork()`.

<Callout type={'info'}>
  You can read more about networks in Stacks apps on [the Networks
  page](/docs/getting-started/networks).
</Callout>

#### `storage`

You can pass a custom storage driver for the state of the client. Defaults to `localStorage`.

```ts
interface Storage {
  getItem: <Value = V>(key: string, defaultValue?: Value | null) => Value | null;
  setItem: <Value>(key: string, value: Value | null) => void;
  removeItem: (key: string) => void;
}
```

#### `onPersistState`

A callback to persist an instance of the client state as a dehydrated string value. Read more about
persistence on [the Advanced Patterns page](/docs/getting-started/advanced-patterns).

#### `dehydratedState`

A string value of the dehydrated state of the client for hydration. Or a function that returns the
value: `(key: string) => string | undefined` Read more about persistence on
[the Advanced Patterns page](/docs/getting-started/advanced-patterns).

## Using the client

Now that you've set up your app, feel free to dig into some of the features you can start making use
of:

- [Authentication](/docs/authentication)
- [Networks](/docs/getting-started/networks)
- [Transaction signing](/docs/transactions)
- [Message signing](/docs/message-signing)
- [Gaia & storage](/docs/storage)
