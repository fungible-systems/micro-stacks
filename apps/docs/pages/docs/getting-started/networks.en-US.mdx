# Networks

<Integrations.Tabs />

Within most blockchain ecosystems, there is a concept of "networks". Within Stacks, networks are of either two "chain modes": `testnet` or `mainnet`.
Mainnet refers to the primary Stacks blockchain, where real transactions and activity occur. Testnet is a staging or non-production
instance of the network. There can be many instances of testnet, but only one of mainnet.

Unlike in Ethereum or other chains,
where the wallet controls what network is set for a given application, that responsibility lies with the apps. This means
an app could be operating only in testnet, where the user might have their wallet set to mainnet.

## Changing the default network

<Integrations.React>
The default network mode is set to `mainnet`. To change default mode of your application, you can pass `network="testnet"`
(or an instance of `StacksNetwork`) to your ClientProvider, like so:

```tsx {9}
import * as MicroStacks from '@micro-stacks/react';

// your app
function App() {
  return (
    <MicroStacks.ClientProvider appName="My sick app" appIconUrl="APP_ICON.png" network="testnet">
      <Router />
    </MicroStacks.ClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</Integrations.React>

### Toggling networks in-app

Sometimes you'll be building an app that can work in many different networks, or take a custom RPC api endpoint.
