# Advanced patterns

<Integrations.Tabs/>

The client can take a few additional parameters: `onPersistState`, `onSignOut`, and `onAuthentication`.


## Server side rendered apps

There are times with which you might want to be able to persist the state of the client in more advanced ways. Most often,
if you're working with a server-side rendered application (SSR), you will want to persist the user state as a session that
can be accessed on the server. Most likely you will want to use some kind of cookie-based storage.

Persisting the state of the client is useful in the context of a SSR application because it allows applications to
do things like prefetch account data on the server, render account related components on the server to prevent a momentary flash
of un-authenticated data, or as an authentication gate for restricted areas of an application.

### `onPersistState`

To get access the client state to persist, you pass a callback `onPersistState` to the client which fires whenever the state
changes. `onPersistState` is a function that takes a string value of `dehydratedState`.

Here is a simple example:

<Integrations.React>

```tsx {9}
import * as MicroStacks from '@micro-stacks/react';

// your app
function App() {
  return (
    <MicroStacks.ClientProvider
      appName="My sick app"
      appIconUrl="APP_ICON.png"
      onPersistState={(state: string) => saveToSessionCookie(state)}>
        <Router />
    </MicroStacks.ClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```
</Integrations.React>

### `dehydratedState`

Now, if you've persisted the state of the client, we need some way of feeding it back to our client when the app loads. The
client takes a parameter called `dehydratedState`, which is the `string` value that you got from `onPersistState` before.
Often times, you'll get this from a cookie which you've saved it to, and then pass it down to wherever you have initiated your client.

<Integrations.React>
```tsx {10}
import * as MicroStacks from '@micro-stacks/react';

// your app
function App({ dehydratedState }) {
  return (
    <MicroStacks.ClientProvider
      appName="My sick app"
      appIconUrl="APP_ICON.png"
      onPersistState={(state: string) => saveToSessionCookie(state)}
      dehydratedState={dehydratedState}>
        <Router />
    </MicroStacks.ClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```
</Integrations.React>
