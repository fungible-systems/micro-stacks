# Announcing v1

Today I'm very happy to announce the release of `micro-stacks` v1.0.0! `micro-stacks` has been a
nights and weekends project for me for over a year, first starting as a project to better understand
the inner-workings of Stacks and to be able to build apps with modern frontend tooling like Vite and
SkyPack.

For those unaware, `micro-stacks` is a collection of JavaScript/TypeScript libraries for building
robust Stacks based apps.

With this release, there are many important updates that I'm excited to share.

## tl;dr

- new `micro-stacks@1.0.0`
- new `@micro-stacks/client` library for managing app-state
- new framework specific bindings:
  - React - `@micro-stacks/react`
  - Svelte - `@micro-stacks/svelte`
  - Vue - `@micro-stacks/vue`
  - Solidjs - `@micro-stacks/solidjs`
- new docs -> [check them out!](https://micro-stacks.dev/docs/overview)
- new examples and `yarn create ustx`
- security audit for core library

## New client library

While working on earlier version of the library, there has always been just one package:
`micro-stacks`. This package contains many sub-modules that are separate, and are broken out based
on function, e.g.: `micro-stacks/clarity`, `micro-stacks/transactions`, etc. This is great when you
know what each module does, but it's less great when you have no idea and there aren't docs
explaining all the different functions and what they do. Often I would get feedback from folks that
there were too many things to have to think about when wanting to accomplish the foundational
functionality that is found in all Stacks apps: authentication, transaction signing, and using Gaia.

With that in mind, I wanted to create a new abstraction on top of all the libraries that would make
these functions really easy to use, while also pushing developers towards building apps with more of
a focus towards user experience. What I mean by this are things like properly handling sessions in
the context of server side rendered applications, or providing feedback when certain actions happen,
such as authenticating or signing a transaction.

This new abstraction is a new library: `@micro-stacks/client`. This package is what handles all
user-session state within Stacks apps, exposes easy-to-use functions that make use of the current
user session like signing transactions, signing messages, Gaia related functions, and
encryption/decryption.

This package is the foundation for all framework-specific bindings and provides a much better
developer-experience when compared to implementing these functions by hand with the lower-level
`micro-stacks` package.

## Framework bindings

With the creation of `@micro-stacks/client`, we now have a much higher ability to create framework
specific binds for `micro-stacks`. This means we now have first-class support for all major
JavaScript frameworks: React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, and even Solidjs. The API between the
framework-specific packages are all very similar, so if you're working on multiple projects that
have different requirements, you don't need to re-learn how to interact with `micro-stacks`.

The framework-specific bindings all use the best-practices for each specific framework, offering
reactive state values and performant functions to accomplish everything you need when building apps:
authentication, transaction signing, message signing, and storage!

## Starter kits

In addition to new framework-specific bindings, there are now up-to-date examples for all of these
frameworks. You can explore these projects here, or get started today by running `yarn create ustx`
to scaffold out any of these starter kits:

**React**

- react _(javascript)_
- react-ts _(typescript)_
- next.js _(typescript)_
- remix _(typescript)_

**Vue**

- vue _(javascript)_
- vue-ts _(typescript)_
- nuxt coming soon _(typescript)_

**Preact**

- preact _(javascript)_
- preact-ts

**Solid**

- solidjs _(javascript)_
- solidjs-ts

**Svelte**

- svelte _(javascript)_
- svelte-ts _(typescript)_
- sveltekit _(typescript)_

## New documentation

In addition to the new starter kits, the documentation for `micro-stacks` has been completely
re-written from the ground up, with a focus on the most common path a developer will take when
building out a new Stacks app.

Additionally, there are more in-depth guides around building apps with meta-frameworks like Remix
and Next.js.

## Security audit

The core `micro-stacks` package successfully completed a security audit (paid for by the Stacks
foundation, thank you!) from KoinFabrik. Thankfully nothing of concern was found. To read the audit
and any comments about what was found, check out this page in the GitHub repository.

## Looking forward

My primary goal in working on `micro-stacks` and all of the additional libraries/documentation has
always been to help folks build better Stacks apps. With that in mind, there is so much more I'm
excited to build:

- Example apps with Sponsored Transactions
- Example apps with Clarinet built-in
- New ways to build Post Conditions
- New tooling to work with projects like `clarigen`
- and much more!
